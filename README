    this README file
    the lab report
    source folder
    sampletests folder [with sample inputs and outputs]

Usage:
    $cd source
    $make [ignore compiler message, please read NOTE]
    $./bmp.o  -p [Prefixfile] -i [InputAddrFile] -o [Outputfile] -W 24 -a [B|M|H]

    (The options may be mentioned in any order)

NOTE:
On doing 'make' the compiler will output the following message which can be ignored:

In file included from /usr/include/c++/4.3/ext/hash_map:64,
                 from lpm.cpp:19:
/usr/include/c++/4.3/backward/backward_warning.h:33:2: warning: #warning This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated header which may be removed without further notice at a future date. Please use a non-deprecated interface with equivalent functionality instead. For a listing of replacement headers and interfaces, consult the file backward_warning.h. To disable this warning use -Wno-deprecated.

This warning occurs because we use hash_map in our code which is a deprecated function for the newer unordered_map. But glibc had to be updated to use the new funtion in the lab, hence we went along with the older implementation.
